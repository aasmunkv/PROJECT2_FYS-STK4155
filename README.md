## Classification and Regression
### Repository for second project in FYS-STK4155: Applied data analysis and machine learning.
#### Authors: Marius Helvig Havgar & Ã…smund Danielsen Kvitvang
In this paper we compare and contrast the basic machine learning methods;linear 
regression, logistic regression and the multilayer perceptron model (MLP).We 
look at two data sets, the Franke function onxandyin range 0 to 1 with and 
without added noise and the Wisconsin breast cancer data. We have seen in the 
Franke function case that a simple regression model more often than not gives 
better results, allthough the best MLP model had a slightly better MSE, In the 
cancer case, an MLP model with ReLu activation and 200 neurons in one hiddenlayer 
seemed to perform best, with an almost perfect accuracy score of 98.8%.

The repository consist of two main parts, namely the **report** and **programs**.
